            </h1>
            <p>
               I love computing skills, how the hardware and software components of the computer carry out their 
               operations behind the scene with effective outcome. I studied Computer Science Education in my bachelors degree.
               My passion for this has made me to set the goal of undergoing different training sessions in 
               different fields of ICT through in-person/online learning management system. So far, i have become more
               acquainted with Microsoft office suite applications, Corel draw application, google IT support, and 
               currently into software development. My goal is to acquire the neccesary skills to excel in my IT career, 
               apply them in problem solving and use the acquired knowledge to impact in the lives of the younger generation.
